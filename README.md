# Rust Multithreaded Web Server (`rmultithreaded_webs`)

This repository contains my implementation of the [Final Project: Building a Multithreaded Web Server](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch21-00-final-project-a-web-server.html) from the official Rust documentation. It demonstrates core Rust concepts such as concurrency, thread management, and graceful shutdown, following best practices in modern systems programming.
